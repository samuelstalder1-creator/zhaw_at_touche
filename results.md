# Results Overview

All metrics are on the `test` split. Confusion matrix columns: TN / FP / FN / TP (rows = gold, cols = predicted).

## Key Findings

- Best classifier overall: `setup6-qwen` (Qwen) and `setup12` (Gemini)
- Neutral reference in prompt (`setup7-qwen`) is competitive but does not beat plain `query_response` classifiers
- Learned embedding features (`setup103`, `setup104`) are far stronger than raw cosine thresholding (`setup100`–`setup102`)
- Both collapse cases (`setup8`, `setup105`) predict everything as positive; root cause is DeBERTa instability
- `setup110` fails because 6 cosine scalars discard the directional information that makes `setup103` work
- `setup111` is the no-classifier control for `setup110`: it uses the same six
  cosine scalars, but scores rows with `response_drift - anchor_cohesion`
  instead of fitting a logistic regression
- Because `setup111` has no committed test artifact yet, the repo still cannot
  answer from committed evidence alone whether the main failure in `setup110`
  is the learned classifier layer or the scalar feature bottleneck itself
